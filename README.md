# 🌆 UrbanPulse

> A full-stack, AI-integrated real-time dashboard to monitor, predict, and respond to urban crises such as pollution spikes, weather alerts, traffic congestion, and public health indicators.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of a capstone designed to showcase full-stack engineering + analytics + smart alert systems.

Currently implemented:
- MySQL storage with normalized schema
- Static dashboard charts for top cities by AQI, pollution component averages, and pollutant trends


Upcoming:
- Live AQI data collection from OpenWeatherMap
- Machine learning predictions for AQI spikes and city-level warnings
- Interactive map with zone highlights
- SMS/email notifications based on thresholds
- Admin and user dashboards
- SMS-based emergency alert system in pipeline
